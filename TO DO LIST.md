TO DO LIST:
- points system;
    - Determine points by how long it takes to unlock each kiwi cage
    - So, for each cage the points;
        => Round down the CURRENT TIME / 10
- add enemies;
    - For each enemy;
        => Let them travel across the level until they either A) Hit a WALL or B) Hit a cliff
- give a black outline to the floating taiaha
- add in the animation that circles around the player
- move the flames across more
- change the offset of the glow to be in line with the taiaha 
- do the touchingCage and touchingBird functions after attack animation has played 

NOTED BUGS:
- when the timer runs out, the hud disappears but the flames do not
- when the player is under the game he does not die
- when holding 'F' the player glides towards whatever direction it was previously facing
